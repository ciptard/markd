# Introduction
## What It Does
The purpose of markd is to produce a static website and/or blog based off of a hierarchical structure of Markdown syntax files.  This static site is produced by processing the Markdown syntax files and from that structure the following will be produced:

* Hierarchical Menu Structure that can be styled via CSS
* Single pages
* Single blog posts
* Post listing pages (i.e. front page of n posts, then subsequent pages to allow browsing of content)
* RSS Feed of recent postings
* [More to come]

# Contributing
On the [Issues page](https://github.com/mwalters/markd/issues), there are issues marked as "[blessed](https://github.com/mwalters/markd/issues?labels=blessed&sort=created&direction=desc&state=open&page=1)". These issues indicate items that are in-line with the core teams vision for the product. Assuming they receive a good change set, it will get committed to the project.

This does not mean that items missing the "blessed" tag will not be committed if someone does the work. It is possible that with good work put towards the item that it will be incorporated to the core product. However, you might want to check with a core dev before picking up work on one of these items.
